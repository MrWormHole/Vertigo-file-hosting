# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: postgres://kxhuznahmhatsi:23e13ee49d7262a1f7c788f380fc54e04ce4ca5173412047de747858a80b2f22@ec2-54-221-201-212.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d3iupekt61ph3b
